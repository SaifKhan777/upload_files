-----I am very thankful for this wonderful oppurtunity----

I have built a simple and light uploading file management system that has easy to understand front_end and easy to devolop back_end. 

The user can addfiles , give file name , filetype and upload a file

A dashboard provides a list of all the uploaded files that can also be downloaded
